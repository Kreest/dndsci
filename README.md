Some work on analysing the DnDSci challenges: [DnD.Sci scenario index](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6QfatwCcmuaDBNeDv/d-and-d-sci-scenario-index)

These contain heavy spoilers for the datasets (at least the ones I got enough analysis done for anyways), don't open the notebooks without trying the challenges yourself first!
