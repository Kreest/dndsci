    "- Your adventuring party has the following martial party members:\n",
    "    - Uzben Grimblade, a Level 5 Dwarf Ninja.[2]\n",
    "    - Varina Dourstone, a Level 5 Dwarf Warrior.\n",
    "    - Willow Brown, a Level 5 Human Ranger.\n",
    "    - Xerxes III of Calantha, a Level 5 Human Monk.\n",
    "    - Yalathinel Leafstrider, a Level 5 Elf Fencer.\n",
    "    - Zelaya Sunwalker, a Level 6 Elf Knight.\n",
    "- You also have some magical items to distribute among them.  You have seven magical items total, one each of:\n",
    "    - +1, +2, +3 and +4 Boots of Speed\n",
    "    - +1, +2 and +3 Gauntlets of Power\n",
    "- You need to choose who will fight each of the four opposing champions:\n",
    "    - House Adelon's champion is a Level 6 Human Warrior with +3 Boots of Speed and +1 Gauntlets of Power.\n",
    "    - House Bauchard's champion is a Level 6 Human Knight with +3 Boots of Speed and +2 Gauntlets of Power.\n",
    "    - House Cadagal's champion is a Level 7 Elf Ninja with +2 Boots of Speed and +3 Gauntlets of Power.\n",
    "    - House Deepwrack's champion is a Level 6 Dwarf Monk with +3 Boots of Speed and +2 Gauntlets of Power.\n",
    "- Your goal is to maximize the number of champions you defeat.\n",
    "- For each opposing champion, you need to choose and equip one of your party members to fight them.  You cannot send the same party member to fight two champions, nor can you equip the same item to two party members.\n",
    "- For example, a solution could be:\n",
    "    - Give Uzben the +4 Boots of Speed and the +3 Gauntlets of Power and send him to fight House Adelon's champion.\n",
    "    - Give Varina the +3 Boots of Speed and the +2 Gauntlets of Power and send her to fight House Bauchard's champion.\n",
    "    - Give Willow the +2 Boots of Speed and the +1 Gauntlets of Power and send her to fight House Cadagal's champion.\n",
    "    - Give Xerxes the +1 Boots of Speed and send him to fight House Deepwrack's champion.\n",
    "    - Do not send Yalathinel or Zelaya to fight at all.\n",
    "- To assist in this, you have a dataset with the records of past fights in the Arena.  Each dataset shows the two fighters that took part, what their levels/races/classes/magical items were, and which one won.\n"
